# Build progress

Status: Phase 0 gate approved and ready for its focused commit; implementation phases remain open. This file is append/update oriented: preserve failed and blocked evidence when resuming.

## Phase 0 — source extraction and baseline

- [x] Confirm source repository, remote, clean status, and pinned upstream SHA.
- [x] Copy controlling design documents into the new repository.
- [x] Extract only the self-contained browser crate and its inline tests.
- [x] Preserve Apache-2.0 license and upstream notice; record every copied source path and digest.
- [x] Pin Rust 1.99.0, Node.js 24.19.0, npm 11.17.0, Playwright 1.63.0, `rmcp` 3.5.1, MCP protocol 2026-07-28, and Chrome for Testing 154.0.8037.92; generate Rust and npm lockfiles.
- [x] Add a cross-platform Rust build, dependency, package, and documentation-link CI baseline.
- [x] Rerun focused checks after review findings are fixed; retain exact commands/results in `verification-matrix.md`.
- [x] Pass scoped independent review; commit with `chore: establish Chrome-only source extraction and provenance`.

## Review record

- Review 1: not approved; corrections and pinned-toolchain checks are recorded in [Phase 0 review 1](review/phase0-review-1.md). Sol re-review approved Phase 0 on 2026-10-06 after independently checking package, docs, dependency, provenance, and Rust gates. The final npm pin in CI was re-reviewed and approved; three-OS CI will run after push.

## Remaining phases

Phases 1–12 are not started. Completion status is tracked by CC-01–CC-24 and B01–B36 in `verification-matrix.md`; no later-phase work is implied by this extraction.
